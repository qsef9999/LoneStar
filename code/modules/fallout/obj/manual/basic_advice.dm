				<h3>The basics of farming in the wasteland of today</h3>

				Slowly starving to death? Stop worrying and start working, the earth will provide, even now. First, you need to understand the basics. 
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>To grow plants reliably you need at minimum, a plot of soil, a rake or cultivator to whack weeds, and a bucket for water and fertilizer. </li>
				<li>For clothing, denim overalls come with a carrying straps for a single rake, shovel or such. Similar straps are used with the leathers hard labor slaves wear.</li>
				<li>Now, buckets hold plenty, some silly wasters use flimsy glass beakers. Don't be one of them, a bucket will hold as much or more. Plastic buckets are the largest, they don't make buckets like they used to. </li>
				<li>Fertilizing from compost: Don't worry about running out. Just stuff in seeds, fruits and vegetables, or food consisting of mostly these things and you will soon have plenty of compost.  </li>
				<li>Fertilizing directly: Stuffing things directly in the dirt gives some nutrition and can have various additonal effects, some harmful to the plants, but using things like toxic waste is one way to mutate plants to other useful strains.
				</ol>
				<p>

				<h3>Making necessary equipment</h3>

				Sooner or later you will need to build some things to help you with tilling the soil. Use your hands and the appropriate material, and you can build the following:
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>From wood: fermenting barrels, compost bins, growbins, seedbins, rakes, buckets </li>
				<li>From metal: seed extractor. </li>
				<li>From sandstone: drying racks, soil plots, gardening pots. </li>
				<li>From cloth: plant bags. </li>
				<li>From leather: gardeners belt, farmers gloves.</li>
				<li>From hay: wicker baskets.</li>				
				</ol>
				<p>
				From here, you know enough to get started, keep on trying things out and learn from old hands, and soon you will be as fat and content as me.

				<h3>How to work a hammer and anvil and produce basic tools.</h3>

				The needed tools are: good gloves, metal ingots, a furnace, wood planks, an anvil and a special hammer.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Gloves: Not all gloves can handle red hot metal, Forgemaster gloves, or most others with fingers, or handwraps are preferable. If you can move the hot metal from the furnace the gloves are good enough.</li>
				<li>Metal ingots: Take the metal stack you want to work in your hand and fashion ingots from it. (inhand crafting) </li>
				<li>Furnace: Needs fuel, welding fuel most commonly. Five measures of fuel burns fast but is enough to heat a couple ingots if you are fast.</li>
				<li>Wooden bits: From planks you can craft sword handles or wooden rods that the finished metal object can be fitted to for a functional tool. (crafting menu forging & blacksmithing)  </li>
				<li>Anvil: The quality of the anvil determines how good the product will be, I recommend using the iron ones provided, if necessary one can be crafted however. </li>
				<li>Hammer: Most commonly a toolbox hammer is used for the first work, which is making a better hammer. Craft one to get going. (crafting menu forging & blacksmithing) </li>
				</ol>
				<p>

				<h3>The process</h3>

				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Heat the ingot, move it to the anvil.</li>
				<li>Prepare the metal, weak, strong and heavy hits enhance the quality but overworking the metal will produce slag and you have to start over. Try two strong hits then move on to making the item if you have no other ideas. </li>
				<li>Follow the secret smithing recipe for the item you want to make, the end result will depend on how much experience you have smithing, and the quality of your tools and preparations. </li>
				<li>The first item you make should be a good hammer, you might need to repeat the process and replace the previous hammer with a new one in steps. Try to have at least a masterworked iron hammer before moving on to other items to save you headache. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>

				<h3>Some secret smithing recipes.</h3>

				These are some of the items that can be made with hot iron and a steady hand.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Hammer: (SFP) Shrink the metal, then fold and punch it.</li>
				<li>Pickaxe: (DDBP) Draw the metal twice, then bend it and punch it like a profligates face.</li>
				<li>Kitchen knife: (SDD) Shrink the metal, then draw it twice. </li>
				<li>Wakizashi: (DFSF) Draw the metal, then fold it, shrink it, and fold it some more, like some sort of damn pie dough.</li>
				<li>Sabre: (DDSF) Draw the metal twice, shrink it and fold it. </li>
				<li>Broadsword: (DFUF) Draw the metal, fold it, upset it, and fold it again.</li>
				<li>Katana: (FFFFF) Fold the metal five times. Because thats how you do it damn it boy, don't question me. </li>
				<li>Zweihander: (UDFSF) Upset the hot metal, draw it, fold it, then shrink it and fold it again. Easy. </li>
				<li>Javelin: (DBF) Draw the metal, bend it and fold it.</li>
				<li>Halberd: (DUFFP) Draw the red hot metal, upset it, then fold it twice and punch it! </li>
				<li>Pike: (DDBF) Draw the metal twice, bend it and fold it. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>

				Know that there are more things to learn, but this is enough to get you started.
