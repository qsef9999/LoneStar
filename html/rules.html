<h3>Welcome to Lone Star!</h3>
<p>We're happy we could have you here to enjoy making stories with us as we go.<br />As any other community, we have our own unique ruleset, and it is required<br />that you take heed of the guidelines as you play and enjoy the community.</p>
</section>
<h2>Server Rules</h2>
<section>
<h3>Category A: Common Sense and Courtesy</h3>
<p><strong>A.1)</strong> <strong>Act in good faith.</strong> The spirit of a rule supersedes its wording.</p>
<p><strong>A.2)</strong> <strong>Do not spam, troll, grief, or otherwise intentionally ruin the game </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.3)</strong> <strong>Do not harass other players.</strong> If someone expresses OOC discomfort,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stop immediately and rethink what you are doing. Sexual harassment will<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not be tolerated. Deadchat is not a protected zone from moderation.</p>
<p><strong>A.4)</strong> <strong>Do not participate in sparking drama or arguments</strong>. Do your best to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keep the peace.</p>
<p><strong>A.5)</strong> <strong>Do not use slurs under any IC or OOC circumstance.</strong> Bigotry is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strictly prohibited and will be met with an instant QC ban with an&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unlikelihood for an appeal.</p>
<p><strong>A.6)</strong> <strong>Do not share in-character events from an ongoing round through </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OOC means.</strong> This is IC in OOC and spoils the round for others.</p>
<p><strong>A.7)</strong> <strong>Cooperate with staff when ticketed.</strong> Do not lie or verbally abuse staff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a ticket. If a staff member tells you to do something in an<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; administrative capacity, you must comply.</p>
<p><strong>A.8)</strong> <strong>Respect the rulings of staff members</strong>. If you want to contest a ruling,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file a ticket on the server Discord.</p>
<h3>Category B: Immersion and Atmosphere</h3>
<p><strong>B.1)</strong> <strong>Do not break immersion for other players.</strong> Maintain the atmosphere of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fallout&rsquo;s setting at all times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lone Star mostly seeks to highlight the more serious elements of Fallout.<br />&ldquo;Wild wasteland&rdquo; and other silly &mdash; but immersion-breaking &mdash; elements are<br />generally not permitted. &ldquo;Fallout is wacky&rdquo; is not an excuse for disrupting<br />the atmosphere. Exceptions apply for unanimous admin approved "Wild<br />Wasteland" rounds - to be properly implemented in the future. Despite this,<br />being funny or unusual for the sake of others' enjoyment is acceptable if it<br />is executed well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.2) Do not reference elements of modern culture in-character.</strong> Fallout <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; canon diverges from real life around the 1950&rsquo;s. Memes have no place in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruh&rdquo;, &ldquo;femboy&rdquo;, &ldquo;soyboy&rdquo;, &ldquo;beta cuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;based&rdquo;, &ldquo;sus&rdquo;, &ldquo;sneed&rdquo;, &ldquo;cope and<br />seethe&rdquo;, &ldquo;LARP&rdquo;, etc. are all examples of terms that must not be used<br />in-character. This list is not exhaustive; use your own judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.3)</strong> <strong>Name your characters appropriately.</strong> Your character name must be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suitable for the setting and atmosphere of Fallout. It is up to staff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; discretion whether or not a name is appropriate for the setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name may not be a reference to famous individuals, real or fictional.</li>
<li>Gag names or overly explicit/slur names are not permitted.</li>
<li>Members of the Brotherhood of Steel and the NCR must have both a first<br />and last name; no nicknames or titles.</li>
<li>Legionaries must have Romanized names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.4)</strong> <strong>Do not explicitly reference OOC mechanics</strong> such as respawning,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AHELPing, admin-healing, round timers, etc. When in doubt, use LOOC, or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; obscure your language such that it fits within the setting and does not hurt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immersion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please do not refer to staff as &ldquo;the gods&rdquo; in-character. Use language <br />appropriate for your role (i.e. &ldquo;High Command&rdquo; for NCR, &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; for Legion, <br />&ldquo;the Elders&rdquo; for BoS, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.5)</strong> <strong>Do not play high responsibility roles without a deep understanding <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the faction you are playing, as well as the mechanics involved <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with leading from the front</strong>. A Centurion or NCR captain not <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; understanding their own command structure, a Follower administrator not <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowing how to do surgery or chemistry, are examples that are deeply <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immersion-breaking.</p>
<p><strong>B.6)</strong> <strong>No End-of Round Grief (EORG) outside of the train. Maintain </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immersion until the round ends.</strong> The train exists to allow end of round<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TDM to occur in that area to let player steam off.</p>
<h3>Category C: Heavy Roleplay Standards</h3>
<p><strong>C.1)</strong> <strong>Lone Star is a roleplay-heavy server.</strong> Players <u>must</u> be relatively fluent in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; English and capable of coherent communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Players are expected to use punctuation and proper grammar/spelling. <br />Egregious spelling errors and an overly simple way of speaking may also <br />mandate an age-check by an admin. Failure to meet this standard may <br /> result in administrative action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.2)</strong> <strong>Continuity and canon persists between rounds.</strong> Previous decisions and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actions will carry over to the next round over. Events may be decanonized <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if all players involved agree, or if staff deem it necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Player character deaths are to be retconned as serious injuries. Avoid <br />referencing the fact that you have died in-character; approach it as though <br />you were merely unconscious, comatose, or otherwise incapacitated.</li>
<li>Players may opt to make their own character deaths permanent; it is their <br />discretion. <strong>However, if a character voluntarily commits suicide, it will <br />be considered a permanent character kill.</strong></li>
<li>You may not escalate to lethal on player characters over events from prior <br />rounds.</li>
<li>If a result of an in-character investigation by an admin-level faction leader <br />(NCR Colonel, Legate, Elder, etc), any execution as a result of this <strong>will be <br />considered a permanent character kill.</strong> A majority of admin-level <br />faction leaders will not escalate to this unless it is a last resort or very <br />egrigious situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.3)</strong> <strong>You</strong> <strong>must roleplay a consistent character</strong> and respond to in-character <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; events like a real person would. Characters that are deemed unrealistic or <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unsuitable to Fallout&rsquo;s setting may be subject to administrative action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural hair colors only. Hair dye exists, but keep it tasteful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable height; anyone taller than 7 feet or shorter than 4 feet should <br />have significant deformities and must be roleplayed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable appearance; you may not be a half-deathclaw mutant or a <br />furred anthropomorphic creature. If you would like special privileges to <br />play a non-standard character, ask server staff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.4)</strong> <strong>You are NOT the protagonist.</strong> Your character must have limitations to <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their knowledge and skills, such as a Legionary generally being unlikely to <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; know much about chemistry or medical science.</p>
<p><strong>C.5)</strong> <strong>Metaknowledge is prohibited;</strong> your character may only possess <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowledge that they would reasonably attain, either through their <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; background or through in-character events. There is a separation between<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what you as a player know, and what your character knows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not communicate with other players out-of-character to gain <br /> in-character advantages &mdash; this is known as metacommunications.</li>
<li>Always keep in mind that your character (in most cases) was born in the <br />23rd century, with little to no knowledge of pre-war America. The only <br />exceptions to this are pre-war ghouls, and to a lesser degree <br />Followers of the Apocalypse and the Brotherhood of Steel.</li>
<li>Characters who are related (i.e. siblings, parent/child, etc.) <strong>may not <br /> share info off-screen.</strong> This is still considered metagaming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.6)</strong> Do not job-hop between roles or factions without in-character progression <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and strong reasoning. Inform at least one admin over discord if you plan <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to do this for good reason, so they can let the team know.</p>
<h3>Category D: Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>D.1)</strong> <strong>In all cases, roleplay supersedes mechanics.</strong> Do not prioritize<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mechanics for roleplay; treat them as a supplement to RP.</p>
<ul>
<li>If an otherwise reasonable action cannot be represented mechanically,<br />players are allowed and encouraged to represent that action through <br /> their roleplay. Other players are expected to respect this.</li>
<li>That said, <strong>no godmodding/powerplaying.</strong> This is taking control of <br />another player's character during roleplay, and is generally not permissible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.2)</strong> <strong>Do not powergame.</strong> Powergaming is defined as abusing game mechanics <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a way that is damaging to roleplay, especially in a way that is unrealistic <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for a character to be capable of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploiting dungeons to complete them in an unintended way through abuse <br /> of mechanics is considered powergaming.</li>
<li>Some other examples of powergaming, generally speaking:
<ul>
<li>A BoS Paladin mixing complex medicines</li>
<li>A Follower Doctor solo-wiping a faction</li>
<li>A Legionary with no medical training performing surgery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.3)</strong> <strong>Do not utilize exploits,</strong> do not share exploits with other players. Report <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; them privately to staff or our development team.</p>
<p><strong>D.4)</strong> <strong>Do not mechanically engage with players who are SSD, AFK,</strong> or <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; otherwise unresponsive but alive.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Do not abuse this protection.</u> Intentionally disconnecting to avoid <br />consequences for one&rsquo;s actions will result in administrative action.</li>
<li>If you must disconnect for the entire round, please despawn yourself <br />at a Matrix point, especially if you are a high responsibility role.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.5)</strong> <strong>You may not, in any fashion, render someone unrevivable, without <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first adminhelping in order to request permission to "round remove" <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a character indefinitely from the round.</strong> Put simply, if you kill someone <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a standard fashion, even in a raid, <em>loot them then leave them</em>. It is, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however, permissible to kill someone and then revive them in order to take <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; them prisoner, enslave them, or more officially execute them through <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; roleplay means later, as long as you are attempting to ensure they are able <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to roleplay for the rest of the round.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caveat:</strong> If the other player in LOOC is fine with your intended manner of <br />executing their character and does not report the incident, we do not <br /> consider this problematic.</li>
<li>The list that is by no means complete as to what is considered rendering <br />someone unrevivable: burial inside a raid-protected faction base, <br /> decapitation, gibbing, brain destruction, bonfiring, excessive offensive <br />chemical overdoses, etc.</li>
<li>Bounty hunters should adminhelp to request permission from either the <br />player they killed or an admin for guidance on claiming their bounties.</li>
<li>Repeatedly bad faith characters that consistently conduct themselves poorly <br /> in a single round-basis can have these protections revoked by an admin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.6) Off-duty roles must not act as regular on-duty faction members.</strong> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Off-duty personnel must defer authority to those on-duty. Do not pull rank <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when off-duty.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a faction is being attacked, off-duties MAY NOT defend their base. They <br /> are required to matrix. Only engage in faction combat if it is self-defense.<br /> If a superior officer orders you to defend the base when off-duty, please <br /> AHELP so we can remind them that this is OOCly disallowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Off-duty BoS may not leave the bunker.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.7) Faction members must wear faction armor in combat.</strong> They may not <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; discard their faction armor in favor of unaffiliated or generic armor. Painting <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generic armor in faction colors does <strong>not</strong> quality it as faction armor.</p>
<h3>Category E: Escalation and Combat</h3>
<p><strong>E.1)</strong> In nearly all circumstances, <strong>combat MUST have ample escalation and <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in-character justification.</strong> Do not escalate on another player without <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strong IC reasoning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEVER INITIATE, OR PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT WITHOUT <br /> ACTIVATING YOUR COMBAT INDICATOR. IF INITIATING, WAIT <br /> A FEW SECONDS FOR THE OTHER PLAYER'S REPLY, UNLESS <br /> ALREADY BEING SHOT AT OR ATTACKED.</strong> The default button to toggle <br /> this is C.</li>
<li>Follow the steps indicated in the Escalation Flowchart, found on the wiki's <br /> Rules Page.</li>
<li>If you provide conditions to someone while escalating (i.e. "If you pull a <br /> gun, you're dead!") and they actively take an action that violates those <br /> conditions, you are free to attack them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.2) Do not use bolas without escalating.</strong> Never throw a bola without <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; activating combat mode. Un-escalated bolas will be punished as harshly <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as any other form of poorly-escalated combat.</p>
<p><strong>E.3) Do not handcuff others without escalating,</strong> either via verbal warning <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or an emote that clearly presents your intention to handcuff them.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a person is unconscious or involved in an ongoing fight, this is not <br />necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.4)</strong> <strong>If a player flees from active escalation, they may be attacked <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immediately.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This explicitly refers to players attempting to run away from a roleplay <br />confrontation when the instigator activates combat intent. We will not <br />consider this "no-esc" or "gank".</li>
<li>If a player attempts to shoot, handcuff, strip, disarm or stun another <br />without escalation/combat indicator active, they may be attacked <br />immediately. Report the individual via adminhelp or through the complaints <br /> tickets on Discord if no staffmember is present.</li>
<li>Dragging away bodies, healing combatants, or otherwise aiding members of <br />an active fight is accepting escalation. Medics have no Geneva Convention <br />rights, this is the post-apocalypse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.5)</strong> <strong>If more than two minutes pass between combat, players are <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; required to re-escalate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>E.6)</strong> <strong>Faction members may join fights involving other faction members</strong> if <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and only if both participants are <u>wearing their faction uniform,</u> with their <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tags (if applicable) clearly visible.</p>
<ul>
<li>NCR and Legion should remain in uniform unless given explicit approval for <br /> a covert infiltration (via raid approval), in which case they may wear each <br /> others' gear explicitly for that purpose.</li>
<li>Non-faction members <u>must</u> make their intentions and allegiance clear <br />before joining combat, faction v. faction or otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.7)</strong> <strong>Base raids, faction or player, ALWAYS must require explicit <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; permission from online staff.</strong> <strong>If you wish to raid a base you must <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AHELP for permission.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base raids require clear in-character justification. Staff may deny raids if <br />they are unjustified or if the balance of power is grossly disproportionate. <br /> As the round progresses later into the game, larger-scale raids will be <br />permitted with more leniency, but not with an unfair balance of power.</li>
<li>Retaliatory raids will be denied if the initial raid incurred major casualties <br />on the attacker. We don't do double jeopardy here.</li>
<li>Refer to the <a title="Guide to Raiding" href="https://wiki.lonestar13.net/index.php/Guide_to_Raiding">Guide to Raiding</a> for a more comprehensive description of <br />server rules and standards regarding base raids.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.8)</strong> <strong>Do not escalate on or steal from other players without provocation <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until at least 30 minutes into the round.</strong> If someone ignores this rule <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tries to rob or kill you anyway, you may defend yourself, as long as you <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; report it after so we can discourage this behavior.</p>
<h3>Category F: Mature Content</h3>
<p><strong>F.1)</strong> <strong>This is an 18+ community.</strong> Underage users will be swiftly removed, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>without exception.</u> Refusing an age check if you are suspected to be <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; underage will result in a permanent ban from the server until you pass the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; age check through an appeal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The staff team reserves the right to perform non-invasive age-checks on <br />any member of the community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All characters that appear in-game must be over 18. Underage <br />characters are not permitted under any circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F.2)</strong> <strong>Mature content is permitted.</strong> This includes erotic roleplay. Explicit <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; consent is required before engaging in sexual content, either in-character, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in OOC notes, or in LOOC. Consent may be withdrawn at any point.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is expected that players treat ERP as an extension of regular roleplay, <br /> rather than a primary focus. <u>Hypersexual characters may be moderated.</u></li>
<li>Do not harass other players for engaging in ERP. If you cannot tolerate <br /> mature content, leave.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F.3) Non-consensual Erotic Roleplay is forbidden.</strong> No non-consensual ERP <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may take place between any player characters. Given the nature of the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setting, sexual assault and similar content still exists within the universe <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>and</u> it may still be used as part of a character's backstory, <u>but</u> it should <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><u>never</u></strong> take place on our server or be canonized between player characters.</p>
<p><strong>F.4)</strong> <strong>Extreme content is not permitted.</strong> This includes (but is not limited to) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any depiction of sexual gore, scatophilia, pedophilia, vorarephilia, or <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bestiality. Keep it off our server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Players may use LOOC to opt out of any objectionable content, <br /> within reason. Please be respectful of others and their sensitivities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F.5)</strong> <u>Do not include oversexualized descriptions in flavor text.</u> Any explicit <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reference art must be clearly marked as NSFW.</p>
